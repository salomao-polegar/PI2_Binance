**LIMITES**

General Info on Limits
The following intervalLetter values for headers:
SECOND => S
MINUTE => M
HOUR => H
DAY => D

intervalNum describes the amount of the interval. For example, intervalNum 5 with intervalLetter M means "Every 5 minutes".
The /api/v3/exchangeInfo rateLimits array contains objects related to the exchange's 
RAW_REQUESTS, REQUEST_WEIGHT, and ORDERS rate limits. 
These are further defined in the ENUM definitions section under Rate limiters (rateLimitType).
A 429 will be returned when either rate limit is violated.

IP Limits
Every request will contain X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter) in the response headers 
which has the current used weight for the IP for all request rate limiters defined.

Each route has a weight which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier weight.
When a 429 is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).
IP bans are tracked and scale in duration for repeat offenders, from 2 minutes to 3 days.
A Retry-After header is sent with a 418 or 429 responses and will give the number of seconds required to wait, in the case of a 429, to prevent a ban, or, in the case of a 418, until the ban is over.
The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.
 We recommend using the websocket for getting data as much as possible, as this will not count to the request rate limit.

Order Rate Limits
Every successful order response will contain a X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter) header which has the current order count for the account for all order rate limiters defined.
When the order count exceeds the limit, you will receive a 429 error without the Retry-After header. 
Please check the Order Rate Limit rules using GET api/v3/exchangeInfo and wait for reactivation accordingly.

Rejected/unsuccessful orders are not guaranteed to have X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-** headers in the response.

The order rate limit is counted against each account.

To monitor order count usage, refer to GET api/v3/rateLimit/order

Endpoints related to /api/*:

According to the two modes of IP and UID (account) limit, each are independent.
Endpoints share the 1200 per minute limit based on IP.
Responses contain the header X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter), defining the weight used by the current IP.
Successful order responses contain the header X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter), defining the order limit used by the UID.
Endpoints related to /sapi/*:

Endpoints are marked according to IP or UID limit and their corresponding weight value.
Each endpoint with IP limits has an independent 12000 per minute limit.
Each endpoint with UID limits has an independent 180000 per minute limit.
Responses from endpoints with IP limits contain the header X-SAPI-USED-IP-WEIGHT-1M, defining the weight used by the current IP.
Responses from endpoints with UID limits contain the header X-SAPI-USED-UID-WEIGHT-1M, defining the weight used by the current UID.
